# LPC10

This implementation of LPC10 was extracted from
[SoX](https://github.com/janstary/sox)
where it has been since around 1996.
The point of this is to make LPC10 a separate library.

## Goals

* Make SoX link against this as an external library.
* Write a separate example coder/decoder.
* Document the library.
